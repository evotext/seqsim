While developed as a general-purpose library, ``seqsim`` is mostly
designed for usage in research within the field of cultural evolution,
and particularly of the cultural evolution of textual traditions. Some
methods act as a thin-wrapper to either the standard Python library or
of to other libraries such as `textdistance`_.
